This repository contains the MPIR library compiled for Windows
in a few configurations:

- Visual Studio 2008 (MSVCR90.DLL runtime), 32 bits
- Visual Studio 2008 (MSVCR90.DLL runtime), 64 bits
- Visual Studio 2010 (MSVCR100.DLL runtime), 32 bits
- Visual Studio 2010 (MSVCR100.DLL runtime), 64 bits
- Visual Studio 2015 (MSVCR140.DLL runtime), 32 bits
- Visual Studio 2015 (MSVCR140.DLL runtime), 64 bits

Yasm 1.3.0 (from http://yasm.tortall.net) was used to compile the assembly
files. For the 32 bit builds, the MMX and SSE2 extensions are used.
